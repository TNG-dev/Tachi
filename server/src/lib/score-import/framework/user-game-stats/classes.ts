/**
 * Calculates a User's Game Stats Classes. This function is rather complex, because the reality is rather complex.
 *
 * A class is simply a hard bounded division dependent on a user. Such as a Dan or a skill level dependent on a statistic.
 * Not all services expose this information in the same way, so this function takes an async resolve function,
 * which is allowed to return its own classes. These will be merged with the classes that *we* can calculate.
 *
 * As an example, we are always able to calculate things like Gitadora's colours. We know the user's skill statistic,
 * and a colour is just between X-Y skill. However, we cannot always calculate something like IIDX's dans. Infact,
 * there's no calculation involved. We need to instead request this information from a service. For things like ARC
 * they expose this on a dedicated endpoint.
 * The custom function allows us to request that data from a custom endpoint, and merge it with things we can always
 * calculate.
 *
 * @param ratings - A users ratings. This is calculated in rating.ts, and passed via update-ugs.ts.
 * We request this because we need it for things like gitadora's skill divisions - We don't need to calculate our skill
 * statistic twice if we just request it be passed to us!
 * @param ClassHandler - The Custom Resolve Function that certain import types may pass to us as a means
 * for retrieving information about a class. This returns the same thing as this function, and it is merged with the
 * defaults.

// This is an empty scss file.
// You might wonder why we import it.
// Well, our "entry point" to our scss is dynamic
// and depends on additionalData (see vite.config.js).
// However, the SCSS loader will not bother with that additionalData
// if it finds no SCSS files to load. This 'empty' file actually
// determines whether we render any CSS at all. Fun!
